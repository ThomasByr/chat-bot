> Please note we do not officially support Windows or MacOS, but we do provide some instructions for those who want to use it on these platforms.

You do not explicitly need a conda environment for the bot to run. But it is always recommended nontheless, especially because the next LTS of Ubuntu won't let users pip-install anything without a virtual environment. At the time of writing, this app `python >= 3.10` to run.

First, install the dependencies :

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0
sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav  gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio
```

Then clone the repository and cd into it :

```bash
# Clones the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands (make sure to give it a name in [environment.yml](environment.yml)) :

```bash
# Creates environment and install dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml -y
conda activate sda
```

Finally, run the app in the background with `nohup` and `tee` :

```bash
# Runs the app in the background
nohup python main.py 2>&1 | tee -a .log &
```

or in the foreground :

```bash
# Runs the app (lets you Ctrl+C to stop it)
python main.py
```

## üîß Usage

Simply sign-in or sign-up to the app, and you will be able to chat with the bot and even chat with other users connected to the same server ! The bellow screenshots are from the desktop version, with WSL2 and Ubuntu 22.04.

| Sign In                              | Sign Up                              | Home Page                            |

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Contributing

If you ever want to contribute, either request the contributor status, or, more manually, fork the repo and make a pull request !

We are using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format the code, so make sure you have it installed and run :

```ps1
black src
```

> The standard procedure is :
>
> ```txt
> fork -> git branch -> push -> pull request
> ```
>
> Note that we won't accept any PR :
>
> - that does not follow our Contributing Guidelines
> - that is not sufficiently commented or isn't well formated
> - without any proper test suite
> - with a failing or incomplete test suite

Happy coding ! üôÇ
